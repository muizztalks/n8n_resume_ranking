# n8n_resume_ranking
An automated n8n workflow that ranks resumes using a Python-based algorithm. It pulls PDF resumes from Google Drive, extracts and cleans their text, matches keywords (e.g., Python, ML, AI), and updates results in Google Sheets with ranking scores. The system also emails HR daily with the top 3 candidates, including summaries generated via a LLM.
